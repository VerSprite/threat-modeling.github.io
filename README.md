# threat-modelling.github.io
This repo aims to provide resources, templates, DFDs, attack trees for those looking to build application threat models for their products/ software. 

This repo is managed by team members at VerSprite and intended to reflect threat modeling artifacts that are in line to the Process for Attack Simulation & Threat Analysis (PASTA). 

For more information on PASTA, feel free to visit https://versprite.com/blog/what-is-pasta-threat-modeling/.

Visit often for more artifacts to be provided by the VerSprite guild of cyber bounty hunters.  


## attack trees
We are first beginning to build out attack trees that can be used by players in every industry or market vertical.  These attack trees by industry will provide a real threat library that is specific to each industry.  These attack trees will be updated yearly. 

The parent node of each attack tree reflects the published threats from the threat library produced.
