# threat-modelling.github.io
This repo aims to provide resources, templates, DFDs, attack trees for those looking to build application threat models for their products/ software. 

This repo is managed by team members at VerSprite and intended to reflect threat modeling artifacts that are in line to the Process for Attack Simulation & Threat Analysis (PASTA). 

For more information on PASTA, feel free to visit https://versprite.com/blog/what-is-pasta-threat-modeling/.
